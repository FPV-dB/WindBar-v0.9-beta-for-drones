Hey there! I am a drone enthusiast and made this app with Swift and XCode for Mac OS. It is really simply to compile yourself, and it's quite a useful app. It can sit in the top taskbar and
show current wind speeds, and you can set a wind speed you're seeking nad it will alert you when its dropped to that level. It also shows a list of maximum wind speeds for a lot of 
popular drones as well as links to some great drone pilot videos, in case you want to watch somee pros.

Here's some screenshots!

Note: This is only a beta, I'm still working o it. Feel free to add stuff to it, but please attribute me. 

Made some screenshots and brief notes 

Please remember to fly your drone within the current laws of your local area. (which will probably change again soon hehe)
